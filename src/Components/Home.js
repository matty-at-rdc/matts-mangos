            <p>In a tropical land, where sunshine dances,</p>
            <p>Mangos thrive, nature's sweetest chances.</p>
            <p>With golden skin and fragrant perfume,</p>
            <p>Juicy flesh, a taste that makes hearts bloom.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Swaying on trees, like ripe orbs of delight,</p>
            <p>Their luscious sweetness, a tropical bite.</p>
            <p>Succulent kisses, the tangy and sweet,</p>
            <p>A symphony of flavors, a heavenly treat.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Beneath the sun's gaze, they ripen with care,</p>
            <p>Whispering secrets of faraway air.</p>
            <p>Each bite reveals a paradise untold,</p>
            <p>Mangos, nature's treasure, worth more than gold.</p>
